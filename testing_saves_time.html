      <h2 class="headline">Testing Saves Time</h2>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <p>
        I'd like to share about my experience during the first module at Turing
        School of Software & Design, and I'll argue that utilizing tests saves time
        (as opposed to consuming more time).
      </p>
      <p>Intense.</p>
      <p>
        Intense is an accurate way to describe the first six weeks of the
        program at Turing.  Many of my classmates liken it to drinking from a
        fire hydrant.  While I certainly don't disagree with that analogy, from
        my perspective, it felt more like choosing the immersion option for
        learning a foreign language.  We were inundated with new material
        and tyring to pick up at much as possible.  Everyone around us, from
        the instructors to the students who were further ahead, was supremely
        helpful and encouraging.  And, much like when you visit another country
        and make a valiant effort to speak the language, whether you are
        successful or not, the effort is noticed and greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were constanly being introduced to new ideas and concepts at a truly
        astounding rate.  We were trying to wrap our heads around the lessons of
        the day, master the concepts covered yesterday, and not drive what we
        learned last week out of our tired minds as we constanly filled our thoughts
        with the new material.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, it is an excellent learning environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it's difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        But yes, it's a fantastic way to learn about software (or another
        language for that matter).
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving on... I believe utilizing tests results in
        <strong>faster</strong> software development, as opposed to slower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Testing saves us time for two main reasons: 1) as soon as we write code, we want to know if it works exactly as we expect
        (bombshell, it usually doesn't work <em>exactly</em> as we expect that first go 'round, and 2) much more importantly,
        it forces us to clarify our thoughts on what we are trying to achieve with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their simplest form, tests are nothing more than taking a moment to
        open an irb session and see if the code we wrote behaves as we
        expect.  Towards the beginning of the creation process of writing an
        application, this is a simple scenario where life exists about how we
        think it does in our mind.  But once any sort of complexity enters our
        application, I start to lose track of how all the pieces fit together.
        And the once-simple task of creating a few objects in an irb session now
        means creating a whole host of objects in order to experiment with how
        the classes I wrote are supposed to interact.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, I cannot keep it all in my head all the time.  Tests are a way
        for me to not worry about keeping it all in my head at one time.
        Instead, I can write the tests once (or maybe twice, I'm still
        practicing), and I rely on the tests to make sure the behavior is
        what I expect and <em>consistent in the future</em>.  This means I can continue to
        make steady progress instead of troubleshooting previously written code
        or checking through every aspect of an application to see if anything
        changed as a result of the most recent bit of code I wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second benefit of using tests is that it forces me to clarify
        exactly what a class, a method, or an object is supposed to do.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, this feels like the difference between <em>'having a good idea what
          that should do'</em> to being able to confidently describe what a piece of
        code is <em>actually</em> doing.  Pondering the difference opened up a world of
        nuance for me.  And testing provides the opportunity for me to nail down
        the mildly fuzzy into something concrete and useful.  By clarifying
        those thoughts on a method by method and class by class basis, I find my
        code is better defined at a fundamental level and therefore more useful
        once it all gets wired together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the first module at Turing is intense, bordering on
        traumatic, but worth every second.  By comparison, testing an
        application is like icing on the cake.
