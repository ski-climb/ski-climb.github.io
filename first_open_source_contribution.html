      <h2 class="headline">First Open Source Contribution</h2>
      <p class="text-center">17 April 2017</p>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <p>
        I'll say it, contributing to open source feels intimidating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logically, in my head, I can put myself in the shoes of someone who is
        maintaining a project.  And, while in that mindset, it's pretty easy to
        imagine that any help is better than no help.  And, hell, if someone
        <em>actually wants to work on something that I'm maintaining in order to
        improve its quality, add a feature, or simply make it easier to use and
        understand</em>?!?!  
      </p>
      
      <p>That sounds amazing.  Yes please.  I'll take two.</p>

      <p>But then I float back into my own head.</p>

      <p>
        Trying to find a project to contribute to for open source is like wandering
        an art show thinking, "I could improve on that."
      </p>

      <p>Now, here's where it gets tricky.</p>

      <p>
        Sometimes the art show I'm wandering through is the kindergarten display
        the day after everyone learned finger painting.  In that case, yes, I feel fairly
        confident that I can contribute something of value ("Jimmy, don't be
        jealous that my finger-painted house is a 3-D cube instead of a slightly
        slanted square with windows which somehow look straight through the house").
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, other times, it turns out that nice Monet fellow made those haystacks
        appear a bit hazy on purpose.  And no, I really don't have anything to contribute
        there.
      </p>

      <p>Finding the sweet spot, then, is imperative.</p>

      <p>
        I had to look for something that I was familiar with, yet hadn't already
        been combed over by the best programming minds in the community, yet <strong>also</strong>
        felt worthwhile to contribute to.  I mean, the whole point of this is to
        make a pull request worth merging, because, well, it's code worth using
        more than once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having found a project to contribute to, I agonized over the code and maybe
        wrote less than 50 lines in total.  Yet it took me forever.  Because open
        source code is public code.  And I wanted to make sure it was correct, more 
        than correct, worthy of sharing.
      </p>

      <p>It was a slightly selfish endeavor as well.</p>

      <p>
        After all, I started the quest to contribute to open source by asking the question:
        Which tools do I find myself reaching for time and again, only to have to
        rewrite the darn thing from scratch each time?  
      </p>

      <p>
        So, to sum up, contributing to open source is intimidating, time-consuming,
        and selfish.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I should be doing more of it.  Because open source code forms the
        foundation of the projects I work on every single day.  If I'm not willing to
        chip in and maintain them, who should?
      </p>

      <p>And, hey, any help is better than no help.</p>
