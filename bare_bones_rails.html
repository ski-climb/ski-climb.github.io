      <p>
        Configuring a real Rails application can seemingly be done about a
        million different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of database should be used?  What will be the database
        cleaning philosophy (truncation or transaction)?  How about the 
        test framework, RSpec or MiniTest?  How should I generate objects 
        that I'll need for testing?  Should I use a front end framwork?  
        Which one? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to narrow the focus a bit, this post is going to be about how
        to fire up a fairly basic rails application.  We won't be using any
        scaffolding or getting into any (at all) business logic.  The aim
        here is to create a completely blank slate that is ready to be
        used.  I'm also going to assume that you already have the rails gem
        installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also do my best to stay away from <em>should</em> as much as
        possible.  This is not an argument for how a Rails app
        <em>should</em> be setup.  It's just an example of one way to do
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this example, I'll be using Rails 5.  That shouldn't have much
        influence on our setup for the extent that we'll get in to.  I
        mention it in case you are using a different version, your
        configuration might look slightly different than the examples
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's dive in.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ rails new my_new_project -T -d postgresql
      </pre>
      <p>
        That's the command to generate a new rails project called
        my_new_project.  The <code>-T</code> skips installing MiniTest
        becauase I will use RSpec for this setup.  The <code>-d
        postgresql</code> is the way to specify a PostgreSQL database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's add some gems to the <code>Gemfile</code> that we'll need.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # Gemfile

        gem 'rspec-rails'
        gem 'capybara'
        gem 'launchy'
        gem 'shoulda-matchers'
        gem 'factory_girl_rails'
        gem 'database_cleaner'
        gem 'faker'
      </pre>
      <p>
        These gems should be added to the <code>:developmet</code> and
        <code>:test</code> groups.  At this point, that group might look
        like the following:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # Gemfile

        group :development, :test do
          # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
          gem 'byebug', platform: :mri
          gem 'rspec-rails'
          gem 'capybara'
          gem 'launchy'
          gem 'shoulda-matchers'
          gem 'factory_girl_rails'
          gem 'database_cleaner'
          gem 'faker'
        end
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>rspec-rails</code> gem will include the <a
        href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails", target:
        "_blank">RSpec</a> test framework (since we opted not to use the
         MiniTest framework which ships with Rails).  <code>capybara</code>
         will be used for <a
        href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara">feature tests</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>launchy</code> provides a <a
        href="https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy">handy little
        tool</a> when running
        feature tests.  It allows you to view the page which is being visited
        during the test by including the line:
        <code>save_and_open_page</code>.  That will open the page (without
        styling) in your browser as the test is running.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>shoulda-matchers</code> <a
        href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers">gem</a>
        provides one-liners which match up (see what I did there?) with 
        Active Model, Active Record, and Active Controller for testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>factory_girl_rails</code> <a
        href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails">provides</a> 
        a way to define fixture
        objects that are used during testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>database_cleaner</code> <a
        href="https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner">provides</a>
        a set of strategies for cleaning your application database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>faker</code> <a
        href="https://github.com/stympy/faker">gem</a> provides a quick way
        to generate fake data.  This proves to be useful when it's time to
        seed the development or test database with real-ish data, similar
        to the way a designer might use lorem ipsum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note for a moment that some gem names use underscores (e.g. 
        <code>database_cleaner</code>) while others choose to use dashes
        (e.g. <code>shoulda-matchers</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have specified the gems, it's time to bundle and run
        the rspec generator.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ bundle install
        $ rails generate rspec:install
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now the gems are in place, and we've bundled.  However, there is
        still a reasonable amount of configuration left.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, let's create the directories where our model and
        feature tests will go as well as the support directory.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ mkdir spec/models/ spec/features/ spec/support/
      </pre>
      <p>
        Let's create the directory where the factories will live as well.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ mkdir spec/factories/
      </pre>
      <p>
        Also, we need to include the methods which
        <code>FactoryGirl</code> gives us in our tests by creating a file
        called: <code>spec/support/factory_girl.rb</code>
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # spec/support/factory_girl.rb

        RSpec.configure do |config|
          config.include FactoryGirl::Syntax::Methods
        
          config.before(:suite) do
            begin
              DatabaseCleaner.start
              FactoryGirl.lint
            ensure
              DatabaseCleaner.clean
            end
          end
        end
      </pre>
      <p>
        And to make sure <strong>that</strong> file is getting included, we
        need to <strong>uncomment</strong> a line in our <code>spec/rails_helper.rb</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # spec/rails_helper.rb

        Dir[Rails.root.join('spec/support/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }
      </pre>
      <p>
        While we're in the <code>rails_helper.rb</code>, let's also
        configure our tests to use the shoulda-matchers syntax.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # spec/rails_helper.rb

        Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
          config.integrate do |with|
            with.test_framework :rspec
            with.library :rails
          end
        end
      </pre>
      <p>
        Sometimes it's nice to eliminate the part of the stacktrace which
        shows the gems.  This is one way to do that.  In
        /spec/spec_helper.rb, include:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # spec/spec_helper.rb

        # This will eliminate the part of the stacktrace which lists the errors in the gems
          config.backtrace_exclusion_patterns << /\.rvm\/gems/
      </pre>
      <p>
        Finally, let's add the front-end framework, <a
        href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">Bootstrap</a>.
        We'll also include the gem <code>bootstrap_form</code> so that we
        can use Bootstrap styling in forms as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including Bootstrap requires a couple steps.  First we'll add the following gems
        to the <code>Gemfile</code>.  Don't forget to <code>bundle
        install</code> afterwards.  And note the non-uniform use of
        dashes vs. underscores.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # Gemfile

        gem 'bootstrap-sass'
        gem 'bootstrap_form'
      </pre>
      <p>
        Next, change the file
        <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</code> to
        <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss</code> (that's a
        <strong>.css</strong> to <strong>.scss</strong> as the file type).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, create a file called
        <code>app/assets/stylesheets/screen.scss</code> where all of the
        application-specific (i.e. not provided by a third-party library like
        Bootstrap) will live.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ touch app/assets/stylesheets/screen.scss
      </pre>
      <p>
        In the above <code>screen.scss</code> file, include the following:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # app/assets/stylesheets/screen.scss

        @import "bootstrap-sprockets";
        @import "bootstrap";
      </pre>
      <p>
        Still installing Bootstrap here...  Finally we'll add the following
        line to <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # app/assets/javascripts/application.js

        //= require bootstrap-sprockets
      </pre>
      <p>
        That line should go just underneath where jquery is required, so
        the <code>application.js</code> might look similar to this:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        # app/assets/javascripts/application.js

        //= require jquery
        //= require bootstrap-sprockets
        //= require jquery_ujs
      </pre>
      <p>
        And we're done!
      </p>
      <p>
        This boilerplate starts us off with a Rails application that uses
        Capybara, RSpec and has a PostgreSQL database.  We're using FactoryGirl to
        create test fixtures and Faker to come up with fake data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we're ready to take advantage of Bootstrap for
        styling, including javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no one-size-fits-all configuration for setting up a Rails
        application, but this is one way to go about it.
      </p>

        Thanks for reading.
